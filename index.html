     Meri Chuhi ❤️, <br><br>
As this year ends and a new one begins, all I can think about is you. Somewhere between time changing its number and the world moving forward, you became my safest place. And honestly, that feels like magic.<br><br>
I still remember our first call so clearly. You said you were an introvert… and there I was, walking into a park in Kharar, just to talk to you properly, like that moment deserved its own space. Two hours passed without us even realizing it. That day, your voice stayed with me. It still does. It’s one of those sounds that instantly calms me, no matter how noisy life gets.<br><br>
And our first video call—how can I ever forget that? I was so excited, stepped out of my house, and then the rain started. I felt genuinely sad, like the universe was teasing me. Then the rain stopped. Just like that. And suddenly everything felt right again, because I knew I was about to see you. That happiness, that child-like excitement—I don’t feel that often. You give me that.<br><br>
You love flowers, and in some quiet way, you are one. Soft, beautiful, sometimes delicate, but strong enough to grow even after storms. 🌸<br><br>
One of the best days of my life was when I told you “I love you” over text… and you said it back. That moment is frozen in my heart forever. I smiled like an idiot, replayed it a hundred times, and thought, yeah… this is special.<br><br>
We’re not perfect. We fight. We misunderstand. We get hurt sometimes. But what matters is this—we always come back. Stronger. More honest. More connected. That’s not weakness, Chuhi. That’s love choosing itself again and again.<br><br>
As this New Year begins, I don’t wish for grand things. I just want more us. More conversations. More laughter. More growth. More moments where we annoy each other and still choose to stay. I want to keep loving you gently, fiercely, and truthfully.<br><br>
Thank you for being my comfort, my excitement, my flower-loving Chuhi.<br><br>
This year was beautiful because you were in it.<br><br>
And the next one? I want to walk into it… holding your hand. 🤍✨<br><br>
Happy New Year, my love. 🥂🎆
